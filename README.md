## Inspiration 

## What It Does 

Checkster is a mobile responsive web application that allows users to upload handwritten checks, and with the power of AI, have their checks digitized and validated.  The project was built to solve the automation of handwritten checks in the banking industry.


 <a href="https://github.com/HaxagonusD/Get-Them-Checks">
    <img src="images/../client/src/components/images/ChecksterDesktop.png" alt="Logo">
  </a>

We approached the Citi Technology x Virtual Hackathon with the intention of leveling up on our technical skills that we are actively learning  in an intensive web development fellowship.  We strategically chose to work on the problem of automating the digitization of handwritten checks because we were excited for the challenge of having an opportunity to implement Google Vision API in our technical solution.

This experience aligns with our personal ambitions as software engineers, front and backend engineers, and UI/UX engineers.

## How We Built It 

This project was conceptualized by building wireframes and prototypes using Figma. We then built our project over 48 hours using React JS, JavaScript and CSS on the frontend, and utilized Node, Express JS and Cloud Vision API on the backend. 

## Challenges We Ran Into 

Of course, no hackathon would be complete without its fair share of hiccups! Some of the notable challenges we faced were related to importing and managing dozens of image and media files. There were also minor challenges with resolving merge conflicts with the various repository requests. 

## Accomplishments 

We accomplished the following in a short period of time:

* Two hackathon newbies were christened on our team!
* Architecting a complete project in a short period of time.
* Overall team synergy and cooperation.
* All the awesome work we collectively invested.

## What We Learned 

We learned the following very quickly:

* Accessing & Navigating Google Vision API
* Importing image files with Webpack to components
* Tailwind.CSS

## What's Next 

We are looking foward to many new opportunities in the near future, including;

* Collaborating on new challenging hackathons together
* Completing coding bootcamp
* Deployed link for this project
